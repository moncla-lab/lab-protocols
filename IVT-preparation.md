# IVT Preparation
New *in-vitro* transcripts are prepared for use as standards in qRT-PCR assays. They are derived from pre-existing plasmids containing a target sequence. Restriction enzymes are used to digest the plasmids, then various phenol-chloroform and ethanol washes purify the final RNA transcript. The product's concentration is then measured and diluted appropriately for use in qRT-PCR.
> Note: This protocol is based on recommendations from the Megascript manual, so for questions or troubleshooting, see that guide.

## Protocol:
  ### Plasmid Digest
   1. Digest ~2ug in a 30uL reaction. Calculate volume needed for 2ug according to concentration of starting plasmid. Digest with the appropriate enzyme (BamHI for SIV plasmid p239 gag_Lifson, HindIII for ZIKV plasmid 700-1500 #3302-5, etc.) Example reactions:
```math
2ug = 2000ng
(833 ng/uL)(V1) = 2000ng
V1 = (2000ng/833ng/uL) = 2.40096 uL
- MP:
- 748 ng/uL * V1 = 2000 ng
- V1 = (2000ng/748ng/uL) = 2.67 uL
- HA:
- 812.3 ng/uL * V1 = 2000 ng
- V1 = (2000ng/812.3ng/uL) = 2.46 uL
