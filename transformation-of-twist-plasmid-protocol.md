## Transformation of Twist Plasmid Protocol
Using NEB® Stable Competent E. coli (C3040H)
Protocol written 3/21/2023 from Jordan Ortz and [NEB protocols](https://www.neb.com/protocols/2013/10/30/high-efficiency-transformation-protocol-c3040h)
### Day 1 Materials:
 - NEB Stable *E.coli* cells (-80°C) (#C3040I, #B9035SVIAL)
 - NEB 10-beta/Stable outgrowth media (RT)(#C3040I, #B9035SVIAL)
 - Lyophilized Plasmid DNA (RT)
 - Molecular grade H2O
 - 14mL round bottom culture tube (#1495911B)
 - LB + antibiotic place (4°C) (#6005)
 - Cell spreader (#1164H45)
 - Waterbath preheated to 42°C
 - Bucket of ice
 - Cell shaker incubator at 37°C
 - Centrifuge
 - P20, P10, and P2 pipettes
### Day 1 Pre-Transformation:
 1. Prechill one 14mL Falcon culture tube on ice per transformation reaction.
 2. Thaw a tube of NEB Stable Competent *E.coli* cells on ice for 10 minutes.
    - While NEB Cells are thawing:
 3. **Resuspend** the plasmid in molecular grade water to 10ng/uL. For example:
    -  Plasmid concentration: 167ng
    -  Molecular grade H2O: 16.7uL
       - Dilute plasmid 10-fold (1ng/uL): Add **9uL Mol. Grade H2O** to a DNAse free tube. Add 1uL resuspended plasmid to the water.
### Day 1 Transformation, Step 1:
 1. Gently mix thawed NEB stable Competent *E.coli* cells by flicking. **Pipette 10uL** of the cells into the bottom of the prechilled 14mL round bottom culture tube.
    - Immediately return any unused cells to the -80°C and be sure to mark the top of the tube as a reminder that it has been opened.
 2. **Add 1-2uL** plasmid DNA directly to the cell mixture. Carefully flick the tube 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA. **DO NOT VORTEX**.
 3. Place the mixture on ice for 30 minutes. Do not mix.
 4. Heat shock at exactly 42°C. Hold the mixture in the 42°C bath for **exactly 30 seconds**. Do not mix. Place on ice for 5 minutes. Do not mix.
    *This step facilitates the entry of plasmid DNA via the creation of pores in the plasma membrane.*
 5. **Pipette 240uL** of the transformation onto the LB + antibiotic plate and spread evenly.
    - Once dried, incubate cells *upside-down* at 37°C overnight or at room temperature over the weekend. *The upside-down orientation of the plates prevents water condensation from dropping into the agar and disturbing the bacterial colonies.*
   > Note: For best clone stability, incubate plates and liquid cultures at 30°C and prepare plasmid DNA from fresh transformants (from plates no greater than 3 days old). Store unstable clones as plasmid DNA, rather than cell-based glycerol stocks.
### Day 2 materials:
 - LB broth (#MT46050CM)
 - Ampicilin - 25mg/mL (#2111)
 - Plastic colony picker
 - Bacterial colonies from overnight growth
 - Conical tube (15mL)
 - Cell shaker at 37°C
 - p20, pipet-aid, and serological pipette tips (10mL, 5mL)
### Day 2 Transformation, Step 2: Inoculation (following overnight or over-weekend incubation):
 1. Using a pipet-aid with serological pipet tip, aliquot **10mL LB** and **20uL of ampicilin** to a 15mL conical tube.
 2. Pipette **3-5mL** of the LB and ampicilin mixture to 14mL culture tube, one for each inoculation.
 3. Carefully select a single colony from the LB culture plate with a plastic colony picker.
    - Swirl the picked colony in the LB + ampicilin mixture ~ 5 times.
 4. Loosely screw the cap and apply tape to ensure the cap stays on during shaking.
 5. Place conical tube(s) in cell shaker for incubation at 37°C overnight.
### Next Steps:
Follow transformation with QIAGEN mini prep (#27104) to analyze DNA purity and concentration. If doing a midi or maxiprep, volume will need to be expanded according to the QIAGEN requirements. Send plasmid DNA to plasmidsaurus for NGS. When the downstream application is the creation of glycerol stocks or use of plasmid DNA in the T7 Megascript kit, use QIAGEN midiprep to achieve a higher concentration yield of purified DNA.
