## Introduction
The purpose of this protocol is to scale up a starter *E.coli* inoculation culture (3-5mL) grown from a single bacterial colony to a volume suitable for QIAGEN Plasmid Midi or Maxi Prep for DNA plasmid production. Using a shaker flask with a volume capacity of at least four times greater than the volume of medium, the starter culture should then be diluted 1/500 to 1/1000 into a larger volume of medium, and grown with vigorous shaking (~300 rpm) at 37°C to saturation (12-18 hours).<sup>1</sup> Using a culture flask with a volume capacity of at least four times greater than the volume of the medium allows proper aeration of the culture medium when shaking which facilitates maximum growth of the colony. The volume needed for the expansion depends on the copy number of the plasmid and whether a Midi or Maxi prep is planned to isolate DNA. A QIAGEN Plasmid Midi kit will yield 75-100ug DNA for high-copy plasmids and 20-100ug DNA for low-copy plasmids.<sup>1</sup> The intended downstream application will determine the yield of DNA needed. Prior to liquid culture scale-up, it is important to ensure LB broth and shake culture flask have been sterilized by autoclave. For instructions, please refer to the following file: [LB-sterilization-autoclave-instructions](https://github.com/moncla-lab/lab-protocols/blob/adding-older-protocols/LB-sterilization-autoclave-instructions.md), in order to prep for the starter inoculation culture expansion.
### Materials
 - Sterilized LB (#MT46050CM) in shaker culture flask (500mL or 1000mL)
 - Ampicilin 25mg/mL (#2111)
 - Cell shaker incubator at 37°C
 - P1000 pipet
### Volume expansion procedure:
 1. Without making contact between the pipet and shaker flask, pipet 200uL of the selective antibiotic directly to sterilized LB in shaker culture flask and swirl to mix.
 2. Pipet 200uL of the starter *E.coli* inoculation culture grown from a single bacterial colony directly to the LB and ampicillin mixture, swirl to mix. *Be careful not to make contact with the pipet to the culture flask, If contact is made, be sure to wipe pipet with bleach and 70% ethanol before using again.*
 3. Cover the mouth of the flask loosely with aluminum foil.
 4. Place the flask securely using flask holders at a shaking incubator for 12-18 hours at 37°C.
 5. Retrieve the culture flasks from the incubator and observe the liquid for cloudiness, an indicator of bacterial cell growth. If growth is observed, proceed with next steps.
### Next steps:
Follow with QIAGEN plasmid Midi or Maxi prep to isolate DNA and determine concentration and purity. Send plasmid DNA to [Plasmidsaurus](https://www.plasmidsaurus.com/) for NGS.
